Registration Authority
Hotels and Tourism Establishments in Abu Dhabi Global Market
Guidance Note

Introduction
Abu Dhabi Global Market (“ADGM”) is a broad based international financial centre, established pursuant
to the Federal Decree No. 15 of 2013 and Abu Dhabi Law No. 4 of 2013 in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.
With its own civil and commercial laws based on Common law, ADGM offers the local, regional and
international business community a world-class legal system and regulatory regime.
This guidance (“Guide”) is issued under Section 28 of the Commercial Licensing Regulations 2015. The
Guide has been prepared by the Registration Authority to assist ADGM registered hotel and tourism
establishments in relation to the application of relevant requirements for such operators in the ADGM.
The Guide also outlines the cooperation arrangements between the Registration Authority and Abu
Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority (“TCA”).

Hotels & Tourism Establishments
This guide applies to all hotels and tourism establishments, including but not limited to tourism
restaurants, tour organisers and operators, travel agencies and suppliers of alcohol, operating in or from
Al Maryah Island.
This guide is also relevant to any ADGM registered entity that wishes to organize or host an event,
exhibition or conference on Al Maryah Island.

Legal Framework
Abu Dhabi Global Market Registration Authority
Abu Dhabi Law No. 4 of 2013 grants the ADGM independent powers and authorities to register and
license ADGM establishments to conduct financial, commercial, economic and professional activities
(including touristic activities) within the geographical scope of the financial free zone prescribed under
Cabinet Resolution No. 4 of 2013 concerning the specification of the geographical zone of ADGM.
Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority
Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority (“TCA”) was established under Abu Dhabi Law No. 2 of 2011
to maintain and promote the cultural heritage of Abu Dhabi and license hotels, hotel restaurants and
tourism establishments in the emirate of Abu Dhabi including the classification and inspection of these
establishments.
Application of Hotel & Tourism Requirements in ADGM
Abu Dhabi Law No. 4 of 2013 exempts ADGM, its authorities, establishments and ADGM employees
from the application of the laws of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the regulations and resolutions of any
local government body, except as may be provided by a special provision in the ADGM Regulations.
However, recognizing the strategic benefit of mutual cooperation and coordination between
governmental agencies, ADGM and TCA have agreed to work together in relation to touristic activities
within Al Maryah Island.
To that end, on 27 February 2017, ADGM entered into an Agreement for Cooperation and Delegation
(“Agreement”) with the TCA. The Agreement recognizes both authorities’ commitment to cooperation
and coordination on the development and oversight of tourism, hospitality and tourist investment on
Al Maryah Island.

The Agreement recognizes ADGM as the competent authority for the registration and oversight of all
commercial activities conducted in or from Al Maryah Island (including hotel and tourism activities),
including the issuance and renewal of commercial licenses, as per Abu Dhabi Law No. 4 of 2013.
The Agreement also confirms ADGM’s role as the issuer of alcohol licenses for hotels and tourism
establishments as well as having responsibility for the issuance of permits for any events, exhibitions
and conferences taking place on Al Maryah Island.

TCA Role and Responsibilities
Under the Agreement, ADGM will adopt the TCA’s laws, regulations and requirements into ADGM’s
commercial legislative framework so that hotels and tourism establishments operating in or from Al
Maryah Island and registered with ADGM, shall remain subject to TCA’s regulations and operating
requirements (including the hotels classification and categorization system).
Further, under the Agreement, the following activities are delegated by ADGM to the TCA:
1. The TCA is responsible for reviewing and/or re-assessing the grade or the classification of any
hotel operating in or from Al Maryah Island.
2. The TCA is responsible for issuing technical approvals or the establishments of hotels, and
reviewing and assessing compliance with the technical pre-approval requirements.
3. The TCA is responsible for inspection and monitoring on tourism-related operating
requirements, and may impose and collect fines from hotels, hotels restaurants and tourism
establishments in case of any violation of TCA regulations.

ADGM Commercial Registration
In light of the above, all hotels and hotel restaurants operating in or from Al Maryah Island, whether or
not currently licensed by TCA, are required to be duly registered and licensed by the ADGM Registration
Authority (as being the competent and sole commercial licensing authority on Al Maryah Island).
Hotels, hotel restaurants and tourism establishments currently holding a Tourism License issued by TCA
are now requested to commence the registration with ADGM Registration Authority (if they have not
already done so) at least one month prior to the expiry of your Tourism License, in order to be able to
continue conducting business activities in or from Al Maryah Island.
Please also note that it is also the responsibility of hotels and hotel restaurants operating in and from
Al Maryah Island to obtain any other permits required by other governmental bodies.
