of an ADGM establishment, such as a change in business name, director or registered address, and also
for striking off or restoration of ADGM establishments.
The Registrar is also responsible for monitoring compliance with and, where necessary, enforcing the
requirements under ADGM’s commercial legislation, including issuing financial penalties, directions,
suspension or withdrawal of licence, depending on the severity of the breach.

What is a Trade Name?
A Trade Name is defined in ADGM’s Business and Company Names Rules 2016 (“the Rules”) as any name
under which a licensed entity conducts business that is different from that entity’s legal name.
For example, ADGM registered company, ‘ABC Limited’, may trade as, ‘Best Consulting Services’.

ADGM Trade Name Requirements
Trade Name Application
As per Part 2 of the Rules, any ADGM registered entity that intends to conduct business under a Trade
Name, must make a Trade Name Application (specifying the Trade Name) to the Registrar.
The application must be in a form specified by the Registrar, with any required supporting documents.
More than one proposed trade name may be applied for and there is currently no fee for a trade name
application. If approved, the Registrar will include the Trade Name on its existing list of Approved Trade
Names on its public register.
Permitted Trade Names
Part 4 of the Rules set out the permitted characters and restrictions for Trade Names. A Trade Name
must not consist of more than 400 permitted characters.
A proposed Trade Name that is the same as an existing Legal or Trade Name on the Registrar’s list, shall
not be approved unless the application is submitted with the written consent of the relevant existing
licensed entity or trade name holder.
