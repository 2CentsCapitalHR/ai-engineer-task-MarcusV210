Voluntary Liquidation Guidance

Part 1 – Introduction
Guidance overview and application
1.1

This guidance provides an overview of voluntary liquidations under ADGM’s insolvency legal
framework, the ADGM Insolvency Regulations 2022. The Guide also provides information
about the documents that must be delivered to the Registration Authority as part of a voluntary
liquidation and the process.

1.2

This guidance does not cover other types of insolvency proceedings available under ADGM’s
insolvency legal framework, such as compulsory winding up, receivership, and administration.

1.3

The guidance applies to ADGM incorporated public and private limited companies, limited
liability partnerships (LLPs) and limited partnerships with legal personality (LPs). For ease of
reference, the term ‘Company’ is used throughout this guidance to refer to ADGM incorporated
companies, LLPs and LPs, unless specifically stated otherwise.

1.4

This guidance is issued under section 28 of the Commercial Licensing Regulations 2015 (CLR
2015).

Legal framework
1.5

The relevant ADGM legislation regarding the dissolution of Companies is the:
a)

ADGM Companies Regulations 2020 (CR 2020); and

b)

ADGM Insolvency Regulations 2022 (IR 2022).

1.6

This guidance provides information on voluntary liquidations and therefore should be read in
conjunction with the IR 2022 specifically, as the guidance will not be able to tell you
everything about a voluntary liquidation.

1.7

ADGM’s Regulations and Rules are available on the ADGM website by following this link
(https://en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com/).

Insolvency proceedings
1.8

Insolvency proceedings are formal measures taken to deal with Company debt. There are a
number of different types of Company insolvency proceedings available under ADGM’s legal
framework. It is important to note that not all companies involved in insolvency proceedings
are insolvent.

ADGM Companies can be dissolved without insolvency proceedings
1.9

ADGM’s CR 2020 provides an alternative Company dissolution process called voluntary
strike off, as well as a power for the Registrar to strike Companies off the register. Both of
these processes are outlined as follows.

Voluntary Strike Off
1.10

Voluntary strike off is the process of dissolving a Company at the Company’s request,
pursuant to CR 2020. There are two methods of voluntary strike off available under CR 2020:

VER1.1-0805023

Page 3 of 12

Voluntary Liquidation Guidance

a)

voluntary strike off by company with notice to members - this is informally referred to
as an “ordinary” strike off, or

b)

voluntary strike off by company supported by a prescribed statement - this is
informally referred to as a “simplified” strike off.

1.11

There are various eligibility requirements that must be satisfied for a Company to apply for
either type of voluntary strike off. For example, in the three months prior to making an
application, a Company must not have traded or carried on business.

1.12

Where a satisfactory application is submitted to the Registrar, the Registrar will issue a public
notice of the Company’s intention to be struck off. If the Registrar does not receive any claims
against the company at the end of the public notice period, the Company’s name is struck
off the register and the Company is dissolved.

1.13

A liquidator or insolvency practitioner is not required to complete this process. However,
voluntary strike off is not an alternative to formal insolvency proceedings.

Further Information
After reading this guidance, if you require further information or clarification on voluntary liquidation,
please email the ADGM Registration Authority at: ra@adgm.com.

Part 2 - Voluntary Liquidation
Liquidation
2.1

The liquidation or ‘winding up’ process ends the life of a Company and ensures that its
property is administered for the benefit of creditors and members. When the liquidation
process is completed, the Company is dissolved and removed from the register.

2.2

During the liquidation process, a Company’s assets are used to pay off its debts, liabilities
and winding up expenses. Any remaining value is distributed to the shareholders.

Types of Voluntary Liquidation
2.3

The IR 2022 provides two types of voluntary liquidations of Companies. The table below lists
each type and the circumstances in which each type may be appropriate.

No.

Liquidation Type

Circumstances

Members’ Voluntary
Liquidation

Where the members want to close a Company and has
sufficient assets to pay its debts within 12 months.

Creditors’ Voluntary
Liquidation

When a Company is unable to pay its debts.

2.4

A solvent Company whose directors have decided to stop trading, may apply for a Members’
Voluntary Liquidation (“MVL”). Alternatively, if the Company has ceased trading for a period
exceeding three months and otherwise qualifies, the Company may apply for voluntary strike
off, as provided for in the CR 2020.

2.5

For an insolvent company, the directors can propose to the members that the Company be
wound up through a Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation (“CVL”).

2.6

Creditors can also apply to wind-up an insolvent Company via a compulsory winding-up by
the ADGM Courts. Compulsory winding-up is not covered in this guidance.
Note: if a Company has already been dissolved, it will need to be restored to the register
before applying for liquidation. Please refer to the CR 2020 for the requirements on company
restoration.

How a liquidation is managed
2.7

Liquidation is overseen by a liquidator (insolvency practitioner). All liquidators appointed to a
voluntary liquidation must be licensed as an insolvency practitioner under the Insolvency
Regulations (Insolvency Practitioner) Rules 2022 (IP Rules 2022). IP Rules 2022 is enacted
on 29 August 2022. Pursuant to IP Rules 2022 a natural person must be registered as an
Insolvency Practitioner in accordance with the IP Rules 2022 in order to be appointed
as a receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, liquidator or provisional liquidator
or an administrator of a Deed of Company Arrangement under the Insolvency
Regulations. Neither a firm, partnership nor body corporate can be appointed as a
receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, liquidator or provisional liquidator or an
administrator of a Deed of Company Arrangement under the Insolvency Regulations,
nor is it required to be registered under the IP Rules 2022.

2.8

For an MVL, the shareholders choose and appoint the liquidator, while for a CVL, the
Company’s creditors choose and appoint the liquidator.

2.9

The expenses of the winding up, including the liquidator’s fees, are payable by the Company
in priority to the claims of unsecured creditors.

Part 3 – Members’ Voluntary Liquidation (MVL)
When an MVL is applicable
3.1

An MVL can take place where it has been decided that a Company is no longer required (for
example, it is no longer needed, there is a lack of business or there no one to continue
running the Company), and the directors of the Company believe that the Company is solvent
(can pay its debts and liabilities).

Declaration of solvency
3.2

Where it is proposed to wind up a Company using an MVL, the Directors (or, in the case of
a Company having more than two Directors, the majority of them), must make a declaration
of solvency.

3.3

The declaration of solvency must state that the directors have made a full inquiry into the
Company’s affairs and that, having done so, they have formed the opinion that the Company
will be able to pay its debts in full, together with interest, within 12 months from the start of
the winding-up process.

3.4

The directors must make a declaration of solvency within the five weeks immediately before
a resolution to wind up the Company is passed.

Making a declaration of solvency
In addition to writing a statement that the Directors have assessed and formed the opinion that
the Company can pay its debts in full, with interest, you should include:
a) the name and address of the company;
b) the names and addresses of the company’s directors; and
c) how long it will take the company to pay its debts (which must be no longer than 12
months from the start of liquidation).
Commencement of liquidation
3.5

The liquidation is deemed to have commenced at the time of the passing of a Special
Resolution (“resolution”) by members for voluntary winding up at a general meeting.

3.6

When the members have passed a resolution for an MVL, the Company must publish a
notice of the resolution in the ADGM within seven days.

3.7

From the commencement of the liquidation, a Company must cease to carry on business,
except where required for its beneficial winding up. For example, a Company may sell any
of its remaining inventory as this is required for its beneficial winding up.

Conversion of MVL to CVL
3.8

During an MVL, if the liquidator decides that the company will not be able to pay its debts in
full within the period stated in the directors’ declaration of solvency, the liquidation becomes
a CVL (see Part 5 of the guidance for more information).

3.9

Where the liquidator takes that decision, the liquidator must call a meeting of the creditors,
notice of which shall not be less than seven days. The liquidator must prepare a Statement
of Affairs of the Company and provide it to the creditors at the meeting. The liquidation
becomes a CVL from the date of that meeting.
