| shown on page 1, details of which are set out on page 2 of this notice, within the period   |
| of 21 days after its service upon the Company. Alternatively, the Company can attempt to    |
| come to a settlement with the creditor. To do this an officer or representative of the      |
| Company should:                                                                             |

| - inform the individual (or one of the individuals) named in Part A above immediately that  |
|   it is willing and able to offer security for the debt to the creditor's satisfaction; or  |
|                                                                                             |
| - inform the individual (or one of the individuals) named in Part A immediately that it is  |
|   willing and able to compound for the debt to the creditor's satisfaction.                 |
|                                                                                             |
| If the Company disputes the demand in whole or in part it should contact the individual (or |
| one of the individuals) named in Part A immediately.                                        |
