Guidance on Client Money

1.

INTRODUCTION

Introduction to Abu Dhabi Global Market
1.1

Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) is a broad based international financial centre,
established pursuant to Federal Decree No. 15 of 2013 and Abu Dhabi Law No. 4 of
2013 (ADGM Law) in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. With its own civil and commercial laws
based on English common law, ADGM offers the local, regional and international
business community a world-class legal system and regulatory regime.

1.2

The ADGM Registration Authority (RA) is the commercial regulator of the ADGM. It is
responsible for the licensing, registration and incorporation of entities seeking to
establish a presence in the ADGM as well as monitoring and enforcing the ADGM’s
commercial legislation and facilitating government services.

Guidance overview and application
1.3

This guidance is issued under section 28 of the ADGM Commercial Licensing
Regulations 2015 and section 18 of the ADGM Commercial Licensing Regulations 2015
(Client Money) Rules 2021 (Client Money Rules).

1.4

This guidance should be read in conjunction with the Client Money Rules.

1.5

This guidance applies to Licensed Firms to whom the Client Money Rules apply by
operation of Rule 2 of the Client Money Rules. That is –
a)

Licensed Firms who are required to comply with the Client Money Rules in
accordance with the Commercial Licensing Regulations 2015 (Conditions of
Licence and Branch Registration) Rules 2021, and

b)

any other person whose conditions of licence require it to hold Client Money
solely in accordance with the Client Money Rules.

1.6

This guidance has been prepared to provide information and clarification on the
operation and requirements of the Client Money Rules.

1.7

The RA considers that the proper safeguarding of money belonging to Clients against
misuse, misappropriation, loss or theft is essential to the pursuit of its regulatory
objectives. Licensed Firms that hold or control Client Money are obliged to have in place
the necessary policies, systems and controls in relation to, for example, the identifying,
handling, segregating and withdrawal of Client Money from Client Accounts.

1.8

Unless otherwise defined or the context otherwise requires, the terms contained in this
guidance have the same meaning as defined in the Client Money Rules.

1.9

A copy of the Client Money Rules is available on the ADGM website here.

CLIENT MONEY RULES

Definitions
Client
2.1

Client is defined in Rule 1(2) of the Client Money Rules as:
“…each person who has entered into or intends to enter into an agreement with
a Licensed Firm for the provision of services by the Licensed Firm”.

2.2

It should be noted that this definition is intended to apply to both founders and
beneficiaries in relation to foundations.

Client Money
2.3

Client Money is defined in Rule 4(1) of the Client Money Rules as:
“…all money held by a Licensed Firm on behalf of a Client in the course of, or in
connection with, the carrying on of any Controlled Activity in or from the Abu Dhabi
Global Market is "Client Money" except where such money is immediately due and
payable by the Client to the Licensed Firm for the Licensed Firm’s own account.”

2.4

The term, “immediately due and payable by the Client to the Licensed Firm for the
Licensed Firm’s own account” is given further meaning in Rule 4(3).

2.5

Examples of ‘immediately due and payable by the Client to the Licensed Firm for the
Licensed Firm’s own account’ include, among other things –
a) a Licensed Firm’s invoice for its fees and charges for services rendered to the Client;
and
b) invoicing for third party expenses incurred on behalf of a Client, such as registration
or filing fees paid by the Licensed Firm and which is to be recovered from the Client.

2.6

‘Immediately due and payable by the Client to the Licensed Firm for the Licensed Firm’s
own account’ does not include, for example, a Licensed Firm issuing an invoice to a
Client a) to obtain and hold money from the Client to cover or expedite the payment of any
future / potential fees (i.e. fees for services not yet provided by the Licensed Firm),
or
b) to cover any future / potential third party expenses or disbursements (i.e. expenses
not yet incurred).

2.7

A licenced Firm must ensure that Client Money is held in a Client Account that is
separate to its own money and separately from another Client’s money (subject to Rule
7).

Client Account
2.8

Client Account is defined in Rule 6(1) of the Client Money Rules, as:
“A "Client Account" in relation to Client Money is an account that–
a) is held with a bank authorised to accept deposits,
b) is established to hold Client Money, and
c) includes words "Client Account", or words to similar effect, in its title,
having regard to any guidance issued by the Registrar.”

2.9

Client Accounts should be established with a bank licensed or authorised to accept
deposits by the relevant financial services regulatory authority in the jurisdiction in which
the Client Account is established.

2.10

The RA may request documentation from a Licensed Firm demonstrating the rationale
and appropriateness for selecting the particular bank where its Client Money accounts
are held.

2.11

In accordance with Rule 4(2) of the Client Money Rules, a Licensed Firm, in holding
Client Money, must hold it on trust for its respective Clients. Rule 5(2) requires that the
title of the Client Account shall sufficiently distinguish the account from any other account
containing money that belongs to the Licensed Firm.

Pooled Accounts
2.12

Rule 7 of the Client Money Rules concerns pooled Client Accounts. Pooled Client
Accounts enable Licensed Firms to hold the Client Money of more than one Client in a
single (pooled) Client Account.

2.13

However, if using a pooled Client Account approach, the Licensed Firm must (i) obtain
clear and specific agreement from each Client beforehand and (ii) ensure that it can
promptly identify individual balances due to each Client.

2.14

Pooled Client Accounts may also be useful when receiving funds from Clients prior to
opening and transferring the funds into a Client’s own Client Account, rather than using
the Licensed Firm’s account to receive the funds. This is particularly so where the funds
received are part of an automated transfer (see Rule 8 of the Client Money Rules).

2.15

In circumstances where a Licensed Firm uses the approach of receiving Client Money
into a pooled Client Account in order to transfer the funds into the Client’s own Client
Account, it need not obtain specific prior agreement of the client for using the pooled
Client Account, provided the funds are transferred to the Client’s own Client Account in
accordance with Rule 8 of the Client Money Rules.

Payment of Client Money into Client Accounts
2.16

The requirements concerning the payment of Client Money into a Client Account are set
out in Rule 8.

2.17

It should be noted that Rule 8(5)(b) provides that where Client Money is only temporarily
held then the requirement to transfer Client Money into a Client Account does not apply.
To be considered “temporarily held”, Client Money should be held for a maximum period
of 30 days from the date of receipt.

Withdrawal of Client Money from Client Accounts
2.18

Rule 10 of the Client Money Rules, requires that there must be appropriate procedures
in place, including authorisations, for all withdrawals from a Client Account.

2.19

It should be noted that a Licensed Firm must not withdraw Client Money to pay for
outstanding fees unless authorised by the Client on whose behalf the Client Money is
held (see Rule 10(3)).

Client Reporting
2.20

Rule 12(1) of the Client Money Rules requires a Licensed Firm to provide a Client Money
report to a Client on a quarterly basis or at such other intervals as are agreed in writing
with the Client.

2.21

The Client money report must include:
a) The client’s total client money balances held by the Licensed Firm,
b) The amount, date, value and descriptions of each credit and debit paid into and out
of the account, and
c) Any interest earned and charged.

2.22

If a Licensed Firm and a Client agree to other intervals for providing the Client Money
report to the Client, such intervals should be no less than annually.

Reconciliation
2.23

A Licensed Firm must maintain systems and controls for identifying money that is not
permitted to be in a Client Account and for transferring any such money that is in a Client
Account out of the account without delay.

2.24

Regular reconciliations, in accordance with Rule 14(2), are an important control and can
minimise losses through early detection of problems. In determining the appropriate
frequency of reconciliation of a Client Account, a Licensed Firm should consider, among
other things, the following factors-

VER2.0-16032023

Page 5 of 7

Guidance on Client Money

2.25

a)

volume, frequency and value of transactions,

b)

the nature and complexity of the business to which the transactions relate, and

c)

risks associated with the transactions.

Subject to consideration of the above factors, the reconciliation should be carried out –
a)

at least on a monthly basis for a pooled account, and

b)

at least annually for a non-pooled account, or more frequently, subject to the
volume and frequency of transactions.

Annual Review of Controls
2.26

Licensed Firms that hold Client Money must implement an independent annual review
of the controls over Client Money in accordance with Rule 15. The review should include
key areas such as:
a) Adequacy of systems and controls,
b) Review of timely reconciliations, and
c) Review of reconciliations against client account statements.

2.27

Where an internal party at a Licensed Firm performs such a review, they should be
operationally independent from the individuals or functions responsible for the
functioning of the firm’s Client Money control processes.
