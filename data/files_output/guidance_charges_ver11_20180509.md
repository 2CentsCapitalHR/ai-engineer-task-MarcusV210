Registrable Charges
Under section 784 of the ADGM Companies Regulations 2015 (“Companies Regulations”), a company that has
created a charge, or any person interested in that charge, may, subject to certain exceptions, submit an
application to the Registrar to register a charge.
In order to avoid sanctions for non‐registration of a charge created by a company (see consequence of failure
to deliver charges in section 791 before the end of the period allowed for delivery), a prudent charge holder
will deliver to the Registrar for registration a charge filing statement in accordance with part 24 of the
Companies Regulations.

Exceptions
The following charges cannot be registered:



a charge in favour of a landlord on a cash deposit given as a security in connection with the lease of
land; or
a charge excluded from the application of the section 784 of the Companies Regulations 2015 or any
other law of the ADGM.

Who can register a charge?
One of the following may register the charge with the Registrar:



the company that created the charge; or
any person interested in the charge.

To file electronically (that is, through ADGM Online Registry solution), lenders (or anyone other than the
company who created the charge) have to apply to register a charge filing statement as a user online. This is
a one‐off registration to enable them to send future charge documents for registration.

Period allowed for delivery of the charge
The application to register a charge must be delivered before the end of the period allowed for delivery, which
is 21 days beginning with the day after the date of creation of the charge, unless a Court order allowing an
extended period is made.

Requirements for registration of charges
The Registrar shall register a charge if, before the end of the period allowed for delivery, the company, or any
person interested in a charge, has delivered all of the following to the Registrar:



an application to register a charge, which can be filed electronically;
a certified copy of the instrument creating or evidencing the charge, if the charge is created or
evidenced by an instrument;

Guidance– Registration of Charge

Page 4 of 16

VER1.1 / 2018‐05‐09



in the case of a charge in respect of which a court order has been made to extend the period allowed
for delivery, a copy of that court order; and
the registration fee of USD300.



For the purposes of Part 24 of ADGM Companies Regulations 2015, a charge of the type described in column
1 of the table below is taken to be created on the date given in relation to it in column 2 of that table.
1. Type of charge

2. When charge created

Charge created or evidenced by an
instrument

If the instrument is a deed that has been
executed and has immediate effect on
execution and delivery, the date of delivery
If the instrument is a deed that has been
executed and held in escrow, the date of
delivery into escrow
If the instrument is a deed that has been
executed and held as undelivered, the date
of delivery
If the instrument is not a deed and has
immediate effect on execution, the date of
execution
If the instrument is not a deed and does not
have immediate effect on execution, the
date on which the instrument takes effect
The date on which the charge comes into
effect.

Charge not created or evidenced by
an instrument

Where a charge is created or evidenced by an instrument made between two or more parties, references in
the table above are to execution by all the parties to the instrument whose execution is essential for the
instrument to take effect as a charge.
The Registrar is entitled without further enquiry to accept a charge as created on the date given as the date
of creation of the charge in a charge filing statement.
“Deed” means a deed governed by the law of the ADGM, or an instrument governed by a law other than the
law of the ADGM which requires delivery under that law in order to take effect.
References to delivery, in relation to a deed, include delivery as a deed where required.

Evidence of registration
If the application to register a charge has been submitted and paid, the Registrar shall accept it as filed and
the Registrar will:



allocate a unique reference code to the charge and place a note on the register recording that
reference code; and
issue a certificate of registration of the charge signed by the Registrar (or authenticated by the
Registrar’s seal) that states:
 the registered name of the company in respect of which the charge was registered; and

Guidance– Registration of Charge

Page 5 of 16

VER1.1 / 2018‐05‐09

 the unique reference code allocated to the charge.
The certificate is conclusive evidence that the documents that must have been delivered to the Registrar
before the end of the relevant period allowed for delivery, were delivered.

Effect of valid registration of a charge
A correctly registered charge is valid against the liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the company
that created the charge. A charge could still be challenged on other grounds, for example, as a preference or
transaction at an undervalue.
Registration may also give notice of the existence of the charge to third parties and so assist in establishing
the priority of the charge by posting the register of charges on the ADGM public register.

Effect of failure to deliver registration of charge before the end of period allowed for delivery
If a charge is not registered within the period allowed for delivery, or is not registered at all, the security will
be considered void (as far as any security is conferred by it) against the liquidator, the administrator, any
creditor of the company.
When the company that created the charge goes into liquidation or administration, the holder of the
unregistered charge will rank as an unsecured creditor. The charge is only void against a liquidator,
administrator or creditor insofar as any security on the company’s property or undertaking that is conferred
by it. It does not render void any contract or obligation for repayment of the money secured by that charge.

Options available to a charge holder if charge is not registered within the 21‐day time limit
A charge holder has the following two options if the application to register a charge is not delivered to the
Registrar before the end of the period allowed for delivery:
•

Submit an application to register a charge along with a court order approving an extension of the
period allowed for delivery.

•

Re‐execute the instrument to create the charge again, and register within the 21‐day time limit
applicable to that charge.

Registration of a charge after the period allowed for delivery has ended
The company or a person interested in a charge can apply to the court for an extension of the period allowed
for delivery if the application to register a charge is not delivered to the Registrar within that period. Note that
there is no guarantee that a court will agree to extend the period allowed for delivery.
The court will extend the period allowed for delivery, on such terms and conditions as the court deems just
and expedient, if it is satisfied that one of the following applies:



the failure to deliver before the end of the period allowed for delivery was accidental, due to
inadvertence or to some other sufficient cause, or is not of a nature to prejudice the position of
creditors or shareholders of the company;
that on other grounds it is just and equitable to grant relief.

The priority of the charge will generally be determined from the date of its late registration and the charge
Guidance– Registration of Charge

Page 6 of 16

VER1.1 / 2018‐05‐09

will rank behind any security registered before that date.

Replacement of an instrument creating a charge
The court may order the copy of an instrument be removed from the register and replaced if it is satisfied as
to one of the following:



the copy of the instrument delivered to the Registrar contains material that could have been
omitted;
the wrong instrument was delivered to the Registrar; or



the copy of the instrument delivered to the Registrar was defective.

The company, or any person interested in a charge, may apply to the court for an order. The court may make
an order on such terms and conditions as it deems just and expedient.
If an order is obtained, the person who applied for the order must submit a Notice of Replacement of
Instrument or Debenture to the Registrar for registration.

Rectification of statements and notices
If there is an omission or mis‐statement in any statement or notice delivered to the Registrar, the court may
order that the omission or mis‐ statement be rectified if it is satisfied as to one of the following:



The omission or mis‐ statement was accidental, due to inadvertence or to some other sufficient
cause, or is not of a nature to prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders of the company.
On other grounds it is just and equitable to grant relief.

The company, or any person interested in a charge, may apply to the court for an order. The court may make
an order on such terms and conditions as it deems just and expedient. If an order is obtained, a Notice of
Rectification must be sent to the Registrar for registration. The Registrar will then rectify the error on the
register as required by the order and place the order on the company record so that anyone searching the
register will be able to read it and understand the effect of the rectification.

Notification of addition to or amendment of charge
If, after a charge is created, it is amended by adding or amending a term that does one of the following:



prohibits or restricts the creation of any fixed security or any other charge having priority over,
or ranking with, the charge (essentially a negative pledge);
varies, or otherwise regulates the order of, the ranking of the charge in relation to any fixed
security or any other charge,

then either the company or the holder of an affected charge can deliver to the Registrar for registration a
Notice of Rectification along with a certified copy of the document effecting the amendment or variation .

Satisfaction or release of charge
There is no statutory requirement for a company to inform the Registrar that:



the debt secured by a registered charge has been satisfied in whole or part;
a registered charge has been fully or partly released;

Guidance– Registration of Charge

Page 7 of 16

VER1.1 / 2018‐05‐09



the charged property no longer belongs to the company.

However, it is in a company’s own interests to inform third parties, such as potential investors and lenders,
that these events have occurred. Therefore, if a company wants to have these events noted on the register, it
must submit a notice of satisfaction or release of charge. There is no fee for filing such notification.
